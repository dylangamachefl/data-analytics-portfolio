# Data Analytics & Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of data analytics and data science projects. This collection showcases end-to-end solutions to complex business problems, demonstrating my skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, machine learning, and translating insights into actionable business strategy.

Each project is contained within its own subfolder and includes a detailed `README.md` explaining the business context, technical approach, and outcomes.

## Projects

### 1. Customer Analytics & Retention Strategy

**Objective:** To reduce customer churn and increase revenue for a UK-based e-commerce retailer by understanding customer behavior.

This project involved developing a complete analytics pipeline, from processing over 540,000 raw transactions to delivering a scannable, actionable retention strategy. Using RFM analysis and K-Means clustering, customers were segmented into high-value ("Loyal Core") and "At-Risk" groups. An XGBoost model was then built to predict churn, achieving 75% AUC and identifying that purchase frequency is four times more predictive of churn than monetary value.

*   **Business Impact:** The model identified an immediate revenue risk of £112,000 from high-value customers and projected an ROI of 1,117% for a targeted retention campaign.
*   **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, K-Means Clustering, Seaborn.

### 2. Retail Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

**Objective:** To solve a critical supply chain challenge for Walmart by accurately forecasting product demand to optimize inventory and minimize costs.

This project tackles the dual risks of overstocking (holding costs, waste) and understocking (lost sales). A LightGBM model was developed to forecast weekly sales at the store-department level, achieving a highly reliable 8.19% Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Error (WMAPE). These forecasts were then used to create a data-driven inventory policy, calculating optimal Safety Stock and Reorder Points to maintain a 95% service level.

*   **Business Impact:** The analysis delivered a clear framework for moving from rule-of-thumb inventory management to an empirically optimized policy, highlighting that demand volatility is the most critical factor for allocating inventory capital.
*   **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, LightGBM, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
